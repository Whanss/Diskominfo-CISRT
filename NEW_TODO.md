# Work Time Tracking Changes

## Task: Remove manual work session functionality and use automatic time tracking

### Changes Needed:

1. [ ] **TicketController.php**:
   - Remove work session methods (startWork, pauseWork, completeWork, getWorkTime)
   - Modify accept() method to set accepted_at timestamp
   - Create complete() method to set resolved_at timestamp and calculate duration
   - Update process() method to remove work session logic

2. [ ] **Ticket.php Model**:
   - Remove work session relationships
   - Update time calculation methods to use accepted_at and resolved_at

3. [ ] **Process.blade.php**:
   - Remove start/pause/complete buttons
   - Show automatic time tracking based on timestamps
   - Update timer display logic

4. [ ] **Routes/web.php**:
   - Remove work session routes

5. [ ] **AdminController.php**:
   - Update dashboard stats to use new time calculation

### Current Implementation:
- Manual work sessions with start/pause/complete buttons
- Separate WorkSession model for tracking time

### New Approach:
- Automatic time tracking from accepted_at to resolved_at
- Remove WorkSession functionality completely
- Use timestamps for all time calculations
